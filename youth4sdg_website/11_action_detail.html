It is also aimed at building their capacities on Products packaging for local consumption and the export markets. In such manner, credible Jobs would be created, economic activities will grow, communities will become safer, and national development will be enhanced.</p>

                        <p>This initiative is carried out through professional capacity building of members who will in turn, be engaged in building the capacities of others at the regional, State, and local council areas. Then, we engage government agencies for their support through adequate advocacy mechanism, letting them know the need for them to corperate with these Women in business in ensuring conducive business environment, as well as ensuring good policies that will aid them in getting their manufactured good to the markets, as well as having priority patronage for made in Nigeria products. We get them to understand how their policies can help grow the economy, as well as create further jobs. We equally , engage the relevant agencies on the capacity building projects at different levels, so that they can inform the these Women SME operators of the relevant policies each agency has, train them on quality control, inform them of open international or regional Trade Policies and Protocols which will enhance their businesses, as well as any reduced bureaucratic measures that can help them access credits, lands, machineries, or oThe supports for their businesses.</p>

                        <p>The initiative is governed at National level by a National Cordinator and Six other officers; the Deputy National Coordinator, The Secretary, the Assistant Secretary, the Programs Director, The Treasurer and the Financial Secretary, The Director of Legal, and the Director of Welfare. This is then followed by six Regional Coordinators covering the Six Regions of Nigeria-that is: the South-South, South-East, South-West, North-East, North-West, and North Central. These Regional Coordinators are each, assisted by a Regional -Secretary. and Regional Treasurer. They report directly to the national leadership. Then we have the 36 States of Nigeria and The Federal Capital Territory coming under these Regional Cordinations. Each State falls under a Region. They report directly to the Regional Heads on Bi-Monthly bases, who collates the reports with her team, and forwards quarterly to the National leadership. Then we have the Local Area Council Cordinators who head local community and grassroots memberships, and report directly to their State Coordinators. Apart from these Leaders, we have the Trustess, made up of 7 Trustees who are advisers, and oversea the properties and activities of the Leadership. The Trustees have a Chairperson, and a Secretary.</p>
