Not only does the Youth4SDG Leadership Camp lay emphasis on knowledge learning, but also on cultivating youths’ ability of participating in and launching activities to realize the UN Sustainable Development Goals, by which youths will turn their knowledge into real actions.

She wished that there would be more youths improving the community and doing their own part of job to promote sustainable development.</p>
                        <p>Ever since September in2015, people all over the world have been positively responding to and realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals, when leaders from more than 150 countries passed the UN Sustainable Development Goals(Macro-Strategy Planning on 2016-2030 Global Development).

                        <p>This time, the Youth4SDG Leadership Camp was held together with ThinkBIG Initiative, supported by Chengmei Charity Foundation. Youth creators around the world came here to share and promote their social initiatives intensively, covering the fields of pension, autism, poor alleviation and so on.

Therefore, Beijing is just a starting point. We will continue to develop the Youth4SDG Leadership Camp throughout China, encouraging more young people to acquire knowledge of sustainable development and initiate their own programs relating to it in the future.</p>
